1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,300
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,160
For real, you can take a second, you've got to feel this to learn it.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,840
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,340
Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,540
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,380
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,800
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,240
Don't you feel one step closer already?

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,260
Like it's already becoming part of your identity?

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Well, bad news.

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,820
You should have kept your mouth shut.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,900
Because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,180
The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,600
less likely to happen.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,980
Anytime you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,740
to be done in order to achieve it.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,280
Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,660
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found

19
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,700
that it's called a social reality that mine is kind of tricked into feeling that it's

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,180
already done.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,140
And then because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work

22
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,260
necessary.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,420
So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals,

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,820
so they hold it to it.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,820
Hold us to it.

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Yeah.

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,660
So let's look at the proof.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,860
1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of Social Psychology, called this substitution.

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,260
1933, Verimaller found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,340
1982, Peter Galvatore wrote a whole book about this, and in 2009, he did some new tests

31
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,620
that were published.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,940
It goes like this.

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,940
163 people across four separate tests.

34
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,020
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal, to the room, and half didn't.

36
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,460
And then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,780
goal, but they were told that they could stop at any time.

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,620
Now those who kept their mouth shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,580
asked afterwards, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve

40
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,940
their goal.

41
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,820
But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes on average, and when asked afterwards

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,860
said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,620
So if this is true, what can we do?

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,420
Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.

45
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,860
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings, and you can understand

46
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,220
that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.

47
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,460
But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you

48
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,100
no satisfaction.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,580
Such as, I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and

50
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,180
kick my ass if I don't, okay?

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,300
So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say?

52
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,300
Exactly, well done.

53
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:29,620
Oh, very funny.

54
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,620
You got me.

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,380
I changed it to a point.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,220
We are Intel.

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,260
Sponsors of tomorrow.
